## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### **Q: Will AI content be good enough to publish without editing?**
**A:** Initially, human review is recommended (MVP = Semi-Auto mode). After the AI learns from feedback, you can transition to Full Auto mode. Our goal is 90%+ of content publishable without edits by Month 2.

### **Q: What if the AI doesn't match GetEducated's style?**
**A:** We're building a site crawler that ingests ALL your existing content to train the AI. It will learn your tone, structure, and terminology. You'll review samples in Week 2 and provide feedback.

### **Q: Can it update existing pages without breaking them?**
**A:** Yes, Phase 2 includes an "update engine" that intelligently merges new content while preserving your existing structure, shortcodes, and custom HTML.

### **Q: What about Google penalizing AI content?**
**A:** Google's official stance (2025): AI content is fine if it's high-quality and helpful. Our system focuses on quality, includes human oversight, and uses your existing content as training data to ensure authenticity.

### **Q: Can we pause/adjust the automation?**
**A:** Absolutely. You'll have full control over automation modes (Manual/Semi-Auto/Full Auto), frequency (X articles/day), and you can pause anytime. Think of it like cruise control - you're always in the driver's seat.

### **Q: What if we want to expand to other sites?**
**A:** The system is designed to be multi-site capable. After GetEducated is running smoothly, we can easily add more WordPress sites with their own crawlers and AI training.
